  "content": "Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced 'view') is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only.[4] Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.\nVue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives. The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.",
